TOLERABLY FAST SPECS (THE LAZY WAY):
  (https://github.com/mcrowe/speedy-specs-talk)

  Unbounce's spec suite: 17 min => 1.5 mins

Background:
  - 3.5 year old code base
  - Rails 3, Ruby 1.9.3
  - ~ 3000 specs
  - 17 min runtime

Goals:
  - Fast enough to run all the time
  - Don't change the code base
  - Minimal changes to the spec suite
